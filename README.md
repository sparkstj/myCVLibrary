# myCVLibrary
This is some code implemented as part of assignment of a CV course.

`filter.py` is a function that takes in an array-like kernel and a grayscale image, and produces a filtered image.

`filter_rgb.py` is an variant of `filter.py` compatable with rgb images (with more color channels).

`grayscale.py` is just a tool to turn a RGB image to a grayscale image.

`myEdgeDetector.py` is a edge detector that takes in a RGB image and produces a list of edges (of class Edgel).
